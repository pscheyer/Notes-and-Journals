20151119 1855CST Folder for Notes and Journals

This dropbox folder contains my notes and journals. I decided it was necessary when about to modify some work I did last week- I realized that the record of modifications and changes was valuable as well and that I may want to revisit earlier drafts, hence the employment of Git and github for version control.
