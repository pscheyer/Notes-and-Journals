# Description of Kegan
David Chapman's blog post on Kegan's psychology has informed my views on the model. Here I will briefly describe the model, its purpose, and a couple of the more interesting implications. If you are familiar with piaget the earlier stages will be similar. 

Kegan's model describes how a person makes meaning of their world. It has five stages, and it is not mandatory for a person to progress through each. Stages 0, 1, and 2  are commonly reached by people of average intelligence over the course of their lives. The fourth is fairly common in high-achieving individuals who are not psychopaths, sociopaths, or other politically gifted abnormal psychologies[1]. The fifth is very rare. 

Stage 0 involves reflexive behavior, corresponds to piaget's sensorimotor development, and a general lack of any learning mechanism other than behavioral reinforcement. This is not to say that complex behaviors cannot be observed- rather, they are not understood. Children are at this level through around age 2, but more specifically the capacity for coherent speech demonstrates a knowledge of causation, abstraction, and differentiation from self which indicates progression to stage 1. In Kegan's ethical framework, the entity is incapable of existence without assistance, makes no differentiation between self and environment (all is self), and is simply exploring the gradations of sensation. I describe this as World-As-Self.

Stage 1 occurs at Piaget's preoperational stage. The concepts of self and other, causation, and language are developed in this stage. Children do not yet understand concrete logic (explicit logic), may have trouble seeing things from different points of view, and tend toward magical beliefs. They tend toward symbolic play and manipulation of symbols. This tends to last until age 7 or so, and the transition to the next stage is demonstrated by explicit logical thought, a development away from egocentricism, and a marked improvement in classification skills. In Kegan, the entity becomes capable of basic understanding of the existence of The Other- the idea of World-as-Not-Self is possible- conscious understanding that things which are not self exist is necessary for the concept of causation. The family's relationship to self and themselves is primary- a few 'best friends' may be included. These other entities are only considered in relation to the self- a parent's happiness may be desirable because it has been positively reinforced, but solipsism remains primary. The world ceases existence when beyond the individual's consideration. The feelings of the self are still primary for both context and action.
Problems are viewed in terms of impact on self, and addressed with stage 0 behaviors. The problems are still not properly understood as arising from independent entities.

Stage 2 occurs at Piaget's Concrete Operational stage. In this stage, explicit logical thought within objects which can be physically manipulated is possible. Egocentricism is reduced (but never fades entirely). Logic and conservation are possible. Tends to finish around age 11, and a transition is demonstrated by abstract thought, ease of conservation and logic, abstract thought, metacognition, etc.  

Stage 3 corresponds to Piaget's formal operational stage. From age 11 onwards, piaget describes the capacity to think abstractly and logically, problem-solve, metacognate, etc. In Kegan, this stage demonstrates the ability to understand systems as collections of groups and impulses which cause the formation of groups. In Kegan's stage, groups are understood- aesthetics, group value systems, authority and role differentiation are understood. Entities may be considered in relation to each other without involving the self (though this is always difficult). These group/tribe/social interactions are usually dominated by histrionic or recently-demonstrated-powerful individuals, as the individual is being considered in context of the group and the histrionic individuals make the most demands on the group. The powerful individuals have the most ability to impact the group[2]. Problems seem to be a person's fault, to be remedied by the group's actions, whether from the dominant or simply histrionic individuals. 
The dom/hist or other behavioral drivers are regarded as stage 1 entities- they do not properly consider the group like the self can. Consider an individual who is chronically late- they have many demands on their time which tend to crop up in the evening, keeping them up late. The boss is seen as a stage 1 entity- a selfish unreasonable entity only interested in histrionics and dominance plays. The person is fired because their boss is a jerk and because they were too good at their job.
The executive is seen as a lucky jerk who gets to be at the top and gets all the good things while reclining being fed grapes, etc, and occasionally fires people on a whim.




Stage 4 has no analogue within Piaget, but is included in formal operational. In Kegan's Ethical Framework, it is characterized by an individual becoming cognizant of roles independent of histrionics or dominance- the groups and their individuals are part of a system with differentiated roles. The individual may transfer positive associations through behavioral reinforcement. Problems arise as a result of individuals not recognizing and adhering to their roles, which inherently contain the capacity to resolve group or lower-level problems. The system includes the world and thus any problem can be considered in light of a system and the roles devoted to problem-solving. Currently in vogue within the positivist system are engineers and scientists and managers.
The boss perceives the chronically late employee as simply not acting like it is part of their job to be on time. They follow all systemic protocols to remind the employee of this, but must eventually fire them because it's policy and making exceptions for people who have been continually offered opportunities to do better is not part of their job. Notably, the subordinate may not have been capable of thinking in systemic terms, and may have simply been behaviorally reinforced into success at many of the job-behaviors. 
The boss perceives the executive as not very good at the boss's job (or the executive's, probably), but thinks that their actions may make sense from their perspective. 

Stage 5 is described by Kegan as a cognizance of the interrelation of systems- science may be seen as once system, business another, craftsmanship a third, etc. Each system has its own specialized roles and behaviors, and an individual is composed of a variety of roles in different systems, balanced and continually rebuilt according to the demands placed upon them. 
The executive of the company is upset that the bureaucrats have to fire slackers who show up late, but that's how business is run and as an executive they can't afford to change those rules or the whole system of the company will collapse. They donate some of the profits from the company to charities and add provisions assisting individuals with more sick leave and benefits, to help the systems and the individuals who have to make a life within them do so. If they see the employee, they avoid eye contact or take other measures to distance themselves, because level 5 thinking is very difficult for apes at all, and working effectively at stage 5 while humanizing the impacted is difficult. 


Kegan's model integrates three different intellectual traditions: 

The first is the humanistic and existential-phenomenological tradition (which includes Martin Buber, Prescott Lecky, Abraham Maslow, Rollo May, Ludwig Binswanger, Andras Angyal, and Carl Rogers). The second is the neo-psychoanalytic tradition (which includes Anna Freud, Erik Erikson, Ronald Fairbairn, Donald Winnicott, Margaret Mahler, Harry Guntrip, John Bowlby, and Heinz Kohut). The third is what Kegan calls the constructive-developmental tradition (which includes James Mark Baldwin, John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, Jean Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, William G. Perry, and Jane Loevinger). The book is also strongly influenced by dialectical philosophy and psychology. (wikipedia)


1- People with abnormal psychologies are more likely to find a niche where their psychology confers an asymmetrical advantage over normal people, and rely on mimicking and careful observation to simulate normal behavior. For example, someone who moves very quickly up an organizational ladder is likely claiming credit for the work of others at each stage, mimicking the behaviors most observable in authentic achievers at each level, and feeling no desire or attachment to the jobs, people, groups, or activities they pass through. Unless they are extremely neuroatypical they still seek pleasure, recognition, and most basic drives common to monkeys- they simply lack the capacity to 'take pride in' one's work, to start a task and see it through to completion, to develop the sort of social bond between group members known as espirit de corps, etc. They may lack any or all of these. The various pathologies, their signs and indicators, and possible methods for development past them will be examined later.

2- Histrionic individuals and powerful individuals have a tendency to regress to stage 1- anyone who lacks a powerful incentive to remain functional at higher orders tends to regress almost immediately until higher-order action is required to maintain their position. However, dominance may also arise as a result of higher-order understanding of dynamics and the conscious use of same, in which case the regressive impulse is no weaker but may be tempered by self-awareness. 


# Basic Elaborations on Kegan
First, Kegan's meaning-making is a phenomenal structure and provides a way to understand oneself and others which is sorely missing in modern philosophy and psychology. It gives comprehensive explanations to a boss who can't understand why a subordinate is constantly late, a subordinate who can't understand why being late even matters to anyone when nothing is done in the first half hour of the job, and a executive wondering how bureaucrats slavish in their devotion to documentation and minutiae and slothful individuals have come to create most of the policy within their organization. 

That said, it has two main problems. First, the concept of meaning-making as a linear progression through stages in which all later stages can act as previous stages would and in which the individual remains at a given stage and progresses in all fields of life simultaneously. Second, the 'final' stage, which is just the penultimate stage with 'meta' tacked on. 

To address the first, I use a fractal framework instead of a linear one. In fractally dictated processes, small variations in conditions can lead to huge differences in outcomes. Also, any portion of the output resembles the others at varying stages. Finally, the process eludes full comprehension by incorporating the coastline paradox. 
In this way, Kegan is upgraded to explain organisms/people/groups/systems/etc who get 'stuck' at particular stages (they are not stuck- they are developing metrics and exploring an existence which diverges from the linear process and yet resembles it), the surprising capabilities of those individuals which elude 'higher order' thinkers are explained (their position allows a type of dedication and focus impossible for others who have developed tendencies toward different meaning-making and are thus distracted), and how such people have lives equally meaningful as higher-order thinkers.

To address the second, I change the final stage from 'meta-systems' to generators- the axioms, processes, machinery, and situations which cause systems to exist in their specific format, continue existence for their time, cease existing, and come into being. 

So, the linear process instead incorporates all its prior substages in each of its 'higher-order' stages- instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we have 0, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6. 
The implied relatively higher value/goodness of 'higher order' stages is explicitly removed in favor of the cognizance of the lack of manichean value in thinking at a different level if it is not valuable. I do however recognize that most readers will not be capable of dissociating the number system from its manichean corollaries and that it is likely that any terms, exercises, thought-processes, capabilities, etc I use for higher-order stages will be co-opted, turned into buzzwords, twisted toward monistic eternalism (this is the same as the others which i already know), etc. I see no way to avoid this and hope that some will gain direct value from the work.

The idea that these steps represent a coherent progression for an individual which has integrity through all views of life, I directly challenge- I believe that an individual can be level 5.5 in some modes of life, 0 in others, and any/all intermediaries, without transitioning through the intervening stages. But I feel that the only way for an individual to achieve a coherent integrity capable of acting at, say, 5.5 _on purpose_ at any time or in any specific endeavors is to pass through each intervening stage slowly, examining as many facets of their life as possible while at each stage, realizing the discrepancies between their higher-order thoughts in some activities and lower-order in others, and embracing this process as part of existence and an ongoing activity which will never stop, though it may be practiced until it comes more quickly and easily. 
Even then I seriously doubt that it is possible for a human mind to sustain higher-order thought for long or trace all (or even most) of its implications. We are wired to live at or around 2.0- anything above that is an effort. We are using technology to build entities capable of existing at the higher levels (computers, corporations, logical systems, etc). But the stock human framework is not well-suited to higher-order thinking. We barely have a frontal cortex as it is, and I am sure that there are completely different cerebral technologies necessary to grasp a >6.6 level mode of thinking. Fortunately, we only have to reach that level and ensconce it in technology to allow ourselves and others to build on it and perpetuate human endeavor at that level, whatever it may be.


# Changing 'Existentialism' into Existism. Because i don't like the extra syllables. 

# developmental stages as fractal but potentially skippable

Been reading about stages of development- must find citation. Elaboration of piaget but continuing through moral etc. 
-Note- Citation is to David Chapman and Robert Kegan. Kegan's *The Evolving Self* is now in my library. 

##Def: Existal- Similar to existential, but incorporating developments in information theory, complexity, algorithmic complexity, cognitive behavioral therapy, heuristics and biases literature, and bayesian reasoning.

##Def: Existal Capability
a combination of agency and mandate in which an entity may become complex in a manner resulting in actions which open a new phase space for its descendant entities. The potential for the impetus/situation combination was inherent in the prior entity, but if viewed in a sequential fashion Existal Capability is a prerequisite for further development past this bottleneck. 

###Agency and Mandate
It thus consists of both 

Agency- a sort of momentum and energy which allows activity including a potential for actualizing a different sort of existence

and Mandate- a fertile ground in which Agency can actualize multiple possible courses of action. A seed contains the resources and machinery to sprout and thus has agency- but most will not sprout unless they gain water and air and non-freezing temperatures, which are thus the Mandate. Once these are gained, the seed may sprout, though its Agency or Mandate may also become snarled, separated, or destroyed, thus preventing its actualization into a different entity. The situation in which the seed exists with access to water, air, and non-freezing temperatures is a situation in which a seed has Existal Capability. 
Furthermore, the seed continues to have existal capabilities until its death, and may progress through the stages as an existal entity without achieving the consciousness to communicate or describe its current state. In this way the genetic mechanism contains the existal capability for many forms of abstraction including the current achievements of the human race. A Seed may also have this capability, but they do not have this Existal Capability, because in the lifespan of the organism wrought by the seed it cannot develop the methods of abstraction necessary for successful emulation of the human race. The species the seed belongs to may have this existal capability and be in the process of developing the agency and mandate to complete this abstraction. But, the seed itself does not, even if the seeds resulting from its transition post-mandate into a different entity (the tree) contribute to the mandate of resources necessary to continue varying and developing into the entity capable of abstraction.
####I originally called these Impetus and Situation, but Impetus is confusing and physically constrained while Situation seems to imply a specific configuration of actual mass. Considered Potential for situation as well, but it is too loaded and i hate the word.

##Stage 0- Undevelopable. 
Consists of inert media, organisms over timespans in which they lack existal capability (such as when dead, or without either agency or mandate, or with a limited agency/mandate which will not result in an existential transition). Higher level entities may revert to stage 0 at any level, though the progression itself generally confers increased existal capability for its entity and their agency. However, progression is not always existally beneficial to either the entity or the agency and mandate which comprise its existal capabilities. 

### Potential for Overdevelopment 
For example, having too many abstracted people may burn through the oil resources necessary to easily spread to other planets, sabotaging the species' eventual growth despite a large percentage of consituents well into a high-order stage. If maintained too long, this could lead to societal collapse prior to the achievement of existal capability for the genetic mechanism, if the earth were rendered uninhabitable by life prior to its spread. 

###Potential for Underdevelopment
Contrast this scenario to a species-entity which is composed primarily of entities at stage 2 or below with a few reinforced stage 3 subentities. An example would be pre-agriculture societies. These lack the capacity for professional specialization necessary to access oil resources or other high-energy propulsion substrates and tend toward positive reinforcement of self-satisfaction with a weak group-enforced normative mechanism, and little systematization with no abstraction. This is a fragile existence, easily snuffed out by a disease, meteor, quasar pulse, or a wide variety of other existential threats unrelated to the activities of the species-entity itself.

##Potential for Existential Capability in Species-Entity
A body of constituents who primarily rest at a stage 3.2 tribal-affiliate existence with behavioral reinforcement for stage 4 professional specialization may have tribal affiliations which contribute to their existal capability such as minimalism and a fervent, religious ardor for interstellar colonization strong enough to result in cathedrals-in-space and outbound pilgrims with the necessary technology and society to survive centuries in space. Thus the species-entity comprised of mostly 3.2-stalled subentities conditioned toward stage 4 roles with a systematic enforcement mechanism governed by a subset of stage 4 subentities or an emergent stage 4 mechanism and limited abstraction. In the case of a subset of stage 4 subentities we would expect some to reach level 5 and confer an existal capability toward increased abstraction, while an emergent stage 4 mechanism might simply maintain the status quo while offering no incentive for further progress. Any of these potential species-entities has a potential for existential capability lacking in our prior examples- it has agency enough to spread to other planets, a mandate of accessible resources sufficient for the goal, and does not have an unfortunate tendency toward overprivileging abstraction in its consumption habits.

##Stage 1

Stage 1 is comprised of the development of awareness and basic operations, essentially a setting of baselines for future feedback operational awareness and a set of action capabilities. Includes knowledge of animal-level reactions [eukaryote-fish-amphibian-lizard-mammal-monkey-ape progression], reactions to lizard-level emotions, base acceptable methods of expressing variations on animal-level reactions in ape-linguistic structure. It is the permanent basis on which later constructs are formed. Animals generally lack the capacity for understanding their own 'baselines'. Stage 1 involves the fine-tuning of capabilities and gaining of the ability to notice subtle differences in areas which others consider important. 

### 0.1
Thus toward the end of normal stage 1 functioning an individual (usually a child) may 
be able to exhibit purposeful physical and athletic coordination, 
imagine basic concepts and communicate them through words and actions, 
hold rote beliefs about what they should imagine and communicate, 
and grow and learn over time through conditioning in a variety of dimensions. Some of these dimensions worth noting during our progression include physical, behavioral (physical actions as seen by others), aesthetic (once seen by others, physical actions as judged by groups) systemic (once seen by others and judged by groups, held to a standard created by a society exhibiting permanence beyond its constituent groups) and meta/abstract (once seen by others and judged by groups and held to standards created by…, ….). 

### Stage 1- Unconsciousness to Reality-As-Self
Physically a child at this stage may be able to play but will have trouble grasping rules.
Behaviorally they will exhibit some consistency and can be trained like other mammals but may not be at ape levels yet. They may not exhibit pattern recognition independent of physically corresponding communication with high bandwidth.
Aesthetically they will not be sophisticated enough to prejudge their potential physical actions or behaviors but may understand that someone/something may judge them and do something. But they will grasp this only as it applies to themselves, not in the context of 'others' or 'groups.' If they 'behave' it is intermittent and due to fear of punishment, not because they understand what it means to be 'good.'
Systematically they are unlikely to grasp the concept that there is a consistent standard made by groups of someone/somethings exhibiting permanence beyond their own existence). 
They are not functioning at meta/abstract levels- while they may have some accidental consistency it is not remembered and they will revert to animalistic behaviors. They cannot yet be 'trained' due to not recognizing the meta-level concept of a world independent of their actions. Example- fish which do not come to the same place at feeding time or when they see motion outside their tank. Fish which do exhibit these behaviors have momentary level 2.1 behaviors when related to key physical reinforcers. 

The entity at this level of functioning is operating under the a paradigm wherein the world consists of their self- there is no separation between self and world. In this paradigm, the variations of existence are physical and result in behavioral modification. Judgments of others are not understood, and correlations are not grasped. Your feelings, desires, actions, and doings are the totality of reality. This is the 'reality-as-self' paradigm, and forms the foundation of progression through all later stages.

##Stage 2

### 2.0 Reality-As-Self to World-Not-Self
Stage 2 (accepting reality of others) which begins at a completed stage 1, continues through a level 1 knowledge of others. This consists of other-awareness and cognizance of basic functions of others, a setting of baselines for expectations of others useful in basic communication and incorporation of others into your agency and schemes for satisficing stage 1 goals. The entity must be capable of awareness and some level of coordinated activity before it can consider that others might have awareness and some level of coordinated activity- others in this case includes such entities as the 'world-not-self' and correlated suggestions that other entities comprised of subtle variations on the 'world-not'self' may exist and have capabilities similar to the self. 

### 2.1 'World-Not-Self,' the primordial 'Other'. 
Once this stage1 knowledge of others has occurred, a stage 2 incorporation of the idea of this 'other' into the self occurs and the entity can model the actions of the other and plan around them to the extent they have accurate stage 1 information. An older child can manipulate a younger, or a more mentally mature child can manipulate youngers. Also, children who are at this level often have a surprising ability to manipulate parents in situations when they have learned to use their stage-1 tools- for example, tantrum control of resources like mobile devices occurs when the parent uses their stage-1 schemas (make the noise stop NOW, goes all the way down to eukaryote) as a reaction to a stage 2 operative child (who has acknowledged the existence of the 'parent' as part of their environment, noted that they are an 'other', and uses a monkey vocalization to throw the parent out of a higher operative mode to achieve a trained response). This description is unfortunately explicit- this operation can be seen in unsophisticated animals with post-lizard operating capabilities including birds and mammals which cannot vocalize or explain their thought processes- this reflective explanatory capability is actually a level 5 capability and comes far after the modeling and control capabilities described here. 

### Dimensional Descriptions at the Primordial Other level.
Before a completed level 1 awareness of others, during the process of grasping the nature of the existence of 'others', the entity may act as described. They may also revert to reality-as-self if they lack existal capability (a combination of impetus and situation in which an entity may become complex in a manner resulting in actions which open a new phase space for its descendant entities.)  to develop their concept of 'the other'

Physically they continue to develop using their other capabilities.
Behaviorally they may understand the connection between specific actions on their part and positive reinforcement. At this stage they may begin to exhibit obsessive-compulsive behaviors if positive reinforcement mechanisms cause a detachment from reality. 
Aesthetically they can correlate behaviors of the world around them and form their own value judgements on the entities they recognize. 
Systematically they can remember how past situations played out when prompted, but will probably revert to animalistic behaviors in between. There is a distinct lack of passive systematic behavior.
Abstractly they can grasp the concept of passive systematic behavior (normalcy) and may express adherence to it if prompted and reinforced, but will not behave in a manner exhibiting self-reflection of their systematic behaviors. They do not grasp the concept of consequences and may have outlandish expectations for the outcomes of their behaviors due to a lack of recursion in their models of entities 'other' to themselves. Their 'others' do not yet have 'parts.' For this a cognizance of the subset of 'others' consisting of 'groups,' which are multiple constituent 'others' acting, is required. 


### 2.2-Having grasped some awareness and respect for 'others' as independent entities. Others-as-Others
Behaviorally they begin to grasp pattern recognition without corresponding physical inputs- they grasp the consistent concept that 'others' hold of 'goodness' as a conditioner tying various communications together and the consequences of others recognizing them as behaving in a manner corresponding to these concepts. They may understand sportsmanship but not strict rules of games.
Aesthetically they begin to establish the foundations of value judgments by correlating the concepts of multiple others.
Systematically they lack cognizance of the permanence of standards and the methods by which they are established and enforced, aside from the direct consequences enforced on them by 'others' they recognize.
They are not functioning at meta levels.

Sufferers of psychopathic disorders never achieve stage 2.2- they don't recognize 'the other' as an entity as real as themselves, but may learn through behavioral conditioning a set of functional reactions for comporting themselves as though they do. This is apparent by their essentially stage 1 actions- they seek to satisfy their animal impulses using others without appreciating that for these others there is a separate perspective which has worth and should be considered prior to action. The world-as-themselves has only one aesthetic judge of consequence- all 'others' only exist as behavioral consequences on the world-as-themselves.





## 3.0 (acting as a member of community), begins with an understanding of 'the group' as an organism/entity, a stage 1 exploration of it, a stage 2 understanding of 'the other group', and then attempts to control this set of groups. An example is sport tribes, political tribes, and religions. Starting with an exploration of your 'group' and its nuances, you gain a stereotypical understanding of some other groups and may begin to grasp some methods by which one group can dominate another, and then identify with a group which has the best chances of dominance and goal achievement for yourself and attempt to modify your surroundings to achieve your goals. People who hold their team, party, religion, or ideology as 'the only real' x are stuck at stage 3.1- they are psychopaths who can recognize a group they have explored, but not that other groups may be as real as their own. 


### 3.1- Exploring Self-As-Group. Conceptual understanding of 'others' as members of 'groups,' and exploration of what holds groups together. Cannot separate self from feelings of others in group- groups are reactive to histrionics, as the feelings of 'others' comprising the groups are considered equivalent to those of self.
Physically, can achieve the pinnacles of physical development in terms of coordination and purposeful action. 
Behaviorally- Can learn 'a sport' as an abstract collection of rules for behavior and history of previous behaviors, but may develop a single-minded focus on physically coordinating purposeful actions to gain positive reinforcement to the exclusion of development in other realms- becoming skilled without awareness of subtleties in other areas, and lacking this awareness while being positively reinforced within their specialty may have difficulty developing sophistication in those areas.

Aesthetically- explores boundaries of group standards within sports and other realms. Can learn what others believe and make internal extrapolations through modeling of the variety of 'others' within these groups that they have encountered, down to the level of understanding they have of these others within the groups. Likely to stereotype groups which they are not part of and do not have exposure to.
Systematically- can understand that boundaries of group standards are create by 'specific others' and potentially model these specific others and their processes well enough to understand 


### 3.2- Group-As-Other Selection and identification with specific groups.
People who hold their sport, political system, value system, or method by which memes are transferred as paramount are in 3.2 
basketball is better than baseball, 
America has the best system of government, 
the Old Testament is good/the New Testament is better/Islam is okay but a bit extreme/monotheism is the only answer though, 
rational argument and the scientific method as implemented through statistical analysis and mathematics are the only way to make progress). 

Sociopathic variants may be psychopaths who have managed some skills in group manipulation, they may lack an understanding of the baselines governing functioning of a particular group's members, or they may simply never really get the level 3 platform- the concept of 'the group' may escape them due to a different level consuming their mind. Thus, psychopaths tend to be inept at acting as members of their community but may exhibit surprisingly successful stage 3 capabilities due to their lack of recognition of 'others'- if you understand group dynamics without respecting others you can act without believing that the consequences to these others matter, and this can be a large asset to a group if it is in a situation where the ruthless control by psychopaths allows it to dominate other groups. 

### 3.3- Grouping of Groups
Aesthetic judgments are applied to genres of groups and activities by evaluation of their composite individuals, the range of activities they involve, and the values built and enforced by the communities. 'Sports' may be considered something of interest or value, although this judgment is required by cognitive dissonance at 3.2. 


## 4.0 (systemic/role). Systems Exist Separately From Groups
A basic stage 3 knowledge is a requisite ante for modern life (psychological retardation and abnormalities precluding participation include those which don't allow progression past 1 or 2.) Most psychopaths and people reduced to animal capabilities are incapable of participating in modern society because they cannot be conditioned by 'others' or 'groups', and hence don't learn enough reactions and basic functions to acquire the resources necessary for continued participation in society without being subjected to the attentions of groups with their own ruthless actions. Systemic, level 4 understanding begins with a level 1 knowledge of metagroups- 

Sports- the idea of sports as systems of rules designed for entertainment through the participation of a few athletes refereed by persons, 
Politics- the concept of political systems as a hodgepodge of individual agents/selection methods/capabilities with varying strengths and weaknesses which tend to all coexist in a functioning society, 
Religious Value Systems- the concept of memetics in analysis of contagious belief systems based on the propagation of desirable values by appealing to imagined and often undisprovable concepts, 
Engineering specific changes in systems is possible for people in 4.0 but not likely, as they don't have a sophisticated grasp of how systems interact with selves, others, and groups.

Did most of the above on the 9th on the plane, continuing from Logan's place in LA. 
On the way home. Been off the meds for a couple days now- flew out on Monday, been having a grand time in LA for tues/weds. Thursday now, headed home to CHI before we head out again tomorrow.

I'll be headed back onto the meds- methylphenidate ER 36mg, bupropion, sertraline. 

Over the past two days been unable to get work done, caustic, acted out a lot, and been drinking. Interestingly haven't been mbing at all for days now, since Sunday, despite being all revved up sun night with no conclusion and then seeing gorgeous ladies all week. One of my longer spells without. 

Anyway, been reading stross. Need to figure out some way of filtering all the fun references out.
