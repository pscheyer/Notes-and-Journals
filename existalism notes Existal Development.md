# Dialectic as generative modeling involving genetic selection via communicative reinforcement. 
# Wittgensteinian need to generate based on logical systems.
# Bayesian dialectic using updating based on generative thought experiments
# Learned-helplessness as heuristic function for simplifying potential courses of action into something which can be held in a limited mind's worth of short/medium term memory.


# Changing 'Existentialism' into Existism. Because i don't like the extra syllables. 

# developmental stages as fractal but potentially skippable

Been reading about stages of development- must find citation. Elaboration of piaget but continuing through moral etc. 
-Note- Citation is to David Chapman and Robert Kegan. Kegan's *The Evolving Self* is now in my library. 

##Def: Existal- Similar to existential, but incorporating developments in information theory, complexity, algorithmic complexity, cognitive behavioral therapy, heuristics and biases literature, and bayesian reasoning.

##Def: Existal Capability
a combination of agency and mandate in which an entity may become complex in a manner resulting in actions which open a new phase space for its descendant entities. The potential for the impetus/situation combination was inherent in the prior entity, but if viewed in a sequential fashion Existal Capability is a prerequisite for further development past this bottleneck. 

###Agency and Mandate
It thus consists of both 

Agency- a sort of momentum and energy which allows activity including a potential for actualizing a different sort of existence

and Mandate- a fertile ground in which Agency can actualize multiple possible courses of action. A seed contains the resources and machinery to sprout and thus has agency- but most will not sprout unless they gain water and air and non-freezing temperatures, which are thus the Mandate. Once these are gained, the seed may sprout, though its Agency or Mandate may also become snarled, separated, or destroyed, thus preventing its actualization into a different entity. The situation in which the seed exists with access to water, air, and non-freezing temperatures is a situation in which a seed has Existal Capability. 
Furthermore, the seed continues to have existal capabilities until its death, and may progress through the stages as an existal entity without achieving the consciousness to communicate or describe its current state. In this way the genetic mechanism contains the existal capability for many forms of abstraction including the current achievements of the human race. A Seed may also have this capability, but they do not have this Existal Capability, because in the lifespan of the organism wrought by the seed it cannot develop the methods of abstraction necessary for successful emulation of the human race. The species the seed belongs to may have this existal capability and be in the process of developing the agency and mandate to complete this abstraction. But, the seed itself does not, even if the seeds resulting from its transition post-mandate into a different entity (the tree) contribute to the mandate of resources necessary to continue varying and developing into the entity capable of abstraction.
####I originally called these Impetus and Situation, but Impetus is confusing and physically constrained while Situation seems to imply a specific configuration of actual mass. Considered Potential for situation as well, but it is too loaded and i hate the word.

##Stage 0- Undevelopable. 
Consists of inert media, organisms over timespans in which they lack existal capability (such as when dead, or without either agency or mandate, or with a limited agency/mandate which will not result in an existential transition). Higher level entities may revert to stage 0 at any level, though the progression itself generally confers increased existal capability for its entity and their agency. However, progression is not always existally beneficial to either the entity or the agency and mandate which comprise its existal capabilities. 

### Potential for Overdevelopment 
For example, having too many abstracted people may burn through the oil resources necessary to easily spread to other planets, sabotaging the species' eventual growth despite a large percentage of consituents well into a high-order stage. If maintained too long, this could lead to societal collapse prior to the achievement of existal capability for the genetic mechanism, if the earth were rendered uninhabitable by life prior to its spread. 

###Potential for Underdevelopment
Contrast this scenario to a species-entity which is composed primarily of entities at stage 2 or below with a few reinforced stage 3 subentities. An example would be pre-agriculture societies. These lack the capacity for professional specialization necessary to access oil resources or other high-energy propulsion substrates and tend toward positive reinforcement of self-satisfaction with a weak group-enforced normative mechanism, and little systematization with no abstraction. This is a fragile existence, easily snuffed out by a disease, meteor, quasar pulse, or a wide variety of other existential threats unrelated to the activities of the species-entity itself.

##Potential for Existential Capability in Species-Entity
A body of constituents who primarily rest at a stage 3.2 tribal-affiliate existence with behavioral reinforcement for stage 4 professional specialization may have tribal affiliations which contribute to their existal capability such as minimalism and a fervent, religious ardor for interstellar colonization strong enough to result in cathedrals-in-space and outbound pilgrims with the necessary technology and society to survive centuries in space. Thus the species-entity comprised of mostly 3.2-stalled subentities conditioned toward stage 4 roles with a systematic enforcement mechanism governed by a subset of stage 4 subentities or an emergent stage 4 mechanism and limited abstraction. In the case of a subset of stage 4 subentities we would expect some to reach level 5 and confer an existal capability toward increased abstraction, while an emergent stage 4 mechanism might simply maintain the status quo while offering no incentive for further progress. Any of these potential species-entities has a potential for existential capability lacking in our prior examples- it has agency enough to spread to other planets, a mandate of accessible resources sufficient for the goal, and does not have an unfortunate tendency toward overprivileging abstraction in its consumption habits.

##Stage 1

Stage 1 is comprised of the development of awareness and basic operations, essentially a setting of baselines for future feedback operational awareness and a set of action capabilities. Includes knowledge of animal-level reactions [eukaryote-fish-amphibian-lizard-mammal-monkey-ape progression], reactions to lizard-level emotions, base acceptable methods of expressing variations on animal-level reactions in ape-linguistic structure. It is the permanent basis on which later constructs are formed. Animals generally lack the capacity for understanding their own 'baselines'. Stage 1 involves the fine-tuning of capabilities and gaining of the ability to notice subtle differences in areas which others consider important. 

### 0.1
Thus toward the end of normal stage 1 functioning an individual (usually a child) may 
be able to exhibit purposeful physical and athletic coordination, 
imagine basic concepts and communicate them through words and actions, 
hold rote beliefs about what they should imagine and communicate, 
and grow and learn over time through conditioning in a variety of dimensions. Some of these dimensions worth noting during our progression include physical, behavioral (physical actions as seen by others), aesthetic (once seen by others, physical actions as judged by groups) systemic (once seen by others and judged by groups, held to a standard created by a society exhibiting permanence beyond its constituent groups) and meta/abstract (once seen by others and judged by groups and held to standards created by…, ….). 

### Stage 1- Unconsciousness to Reality-As-Self
Physically a child at this stage may be able to play but will have trouble grasping rules.
Behaviorally they will exhibit some consistency and can be trained like other mammals but may not be at ape levels yet. They may not exhibit pattern recognition independent of physically corresponding communication with high bandwidth.
Aesthetically they will not be sophisticated enough to prejudge their potential physical actions or behaviors but may understand that someone/something may judge them and do something. But they will grasp this only as it applies to themselves, not in the context of 'others' or 'groups.' If they 'behave' it is intermittent and due to fear of punishment, not because they understand what it means to be 'good.'
Systematically they are unlikely to grasp the concept that there is a consistent standard made by groups of someone/somethings exhibiting permanence beyond their own existence). 
They are not functioning at meta/abstract levels- while they may have some accidental consistency it is not remembered and they will revert to animalistic behaviors. They cannot yet be 'trained' due to not recognizing the meta-level concept of a world independent of their actions. Example- fish which do not come to the same place at feeding time or when they see motion outside their tank. Fish which do exhibit these behaviors have momentary level 2.1 behaviors when related to key physical reinforcers. 

The entity at this level of functioning is operating under the a paradigm wherein the world consists of their self- there is no separation between self and world. In this paradigm, the variations of existence are physical and result in behavioral modification. Judgments of others are not understood, and correlations are not grasped. Your feelings, desires, actions, and doings are the totality of reality. This is the 'reality-as-self' paradigm, and forms the foundation of progression through all later stages.

##Stage 2

### 2.0 Reality-As-Self to World-Not-Self
Stage 2 (accepting reality of others) which begins at a completed stage 1, continues through a level 1 knowledge of others. This consists of other-awareness and cognizance of basic functions of others, a setting of baselines for expectations of others useful in basic communication and incorporation of others into your agency and schemes for satisficing stage 1 goals. The entity must be capable of awareness and some level of coordinated activity before it can consider that others might have awareness and some level of coordinated activity- others in this case includes such entities as the 'world-not-self' and correlated suggestions that other entities comprised of subtle variations on the 'world-not'self' may exist and have capabilities similar to the self. 

### 2.1 'World-Not-Self,' the primordial 'Other'. 
Once this stage1 knowledge of others has occurred, a stage 2 incorporation of the idea of this 'other' into the self occurs and the entity can model the actions of the other and plan around them to the extent they have accurate stage 1 information. An older child can manipulate a younger, or a more mentally mature child can manipulate youngers. Also, children who are at this level often have a surprising ability to manipulate parents in situations when they have learned to use their stage-1 tools- for example, tantrum control of resources like mobile devices occurs when the parent uses their stage-1 schemas (make the noise stop NOW, goes all the way down to eukaryote) as a reaction to a stage 2 operative child (who has acknowledged the existence of the 'parent' as part of their environment, noted that they are an 'other', and uses a monkey vocalization to throw the parent out of a higher operative mode to achieve a trained response). This description is unfortunately explicit- this operation can be seen in unsophisticated animals with post-lizard operating capabilities including birds and mammals which cannot vocalize or explain their thought processes- this reflective explanatory capability is actually a level 5 capability and comes far after the modeling and control capabilities described here. 

### Dimensional Descriptions at the Primordial Other level.
Before a completed level 1 awareness of others, during the process of grasping the nature of the existence of 'others', the entity may act as described. They may also revert to reality-as-self if they lack existal capability (a combination of impetus and situation in which an entity may become complex in a manner resulting in actions which open a new phase space for its descendant entities.)  to develop their concept of 'the other'

Physically they continue to develop using their other capabilities.
Behaviorally they may understand the connection between specific actions on their part and positive reinforcement. At this stage they may begin to exhibit obsessive-compulsive behaviors if positive reinforcement mechanisms cause a detachment from reality. 
Aesthetically they can correlate behaviors of the world around them and form their own value judgements on the entities they recognize. 
Systematically they can remember how past situations played out when prompted, but will probably revert to animalistic behaviors in between. There is a distinct lack of passive systematic behavior.
Abstractly they can grasp the concept of passive systematic behavior (normalcy) and may express adherence to it if prompted and reinforced, but will not behave in a manner exhibiting self-reflection of their systematic behaviors. They do not grasp the concept of consequences and may have outlandish expectations for the outcomes of their behaviors due to a lack of recursion in their models of entities 'other' to themselves. Their 'others' do not yet have 'parts.' For this a cognizance of the subset of 'others' consisting of 'groups,' which are multiple constituent 'others' acting, is required. 


### 2.2-Having grasped some awareness and respect for 'others' as independent entities. Others-as-Others
Behaviorally they begin to grasp pattern recognition without corresponding physical inputs- they grasp the consistent concept that 'others' hold of 'goodness' as a conditioner tying various communications together and the consequences of others recognizing them as behaving in a manner corresponding to these concepts. They may understand sportsmanship but not strict rules of games.
Aesthetically they begin to establish the foundations of value judgments by correlating the concepts of multiple others.
Systematically they lack cognizance of the permanence of standards and the methods by which they are established and enforced, aside from the direct consequences enforced on them by 'others' they recognize.
They are not functioning at meta levels.

Sufferers of psychopathic disorders never achieve stage 2.2- they don't recognize 'the other' as an entity as real as themselves, but may learn through behavioral conditioning a set of functional reactions for comporting themselves as though they do. This is apparent by their essentially stage 1 actions- they seek to satisfy their animal impulses using others without appreciating that for these others there is a separate perspective which has worth and should be considered prior to action. The world-as-themselves has only one aesthetic judge of consequence- all 'others' only exist as behavioral consequences on the world-as-themselves.





## 3.0 (acting as a member of community), begins with an understanding of 'the group' as an organism/entity, a stage 1 exploration of it, a stage 2 understanding of 'the other group', and then attempts to control this set of groups. An example is sport tribes, political tribes, and religions. Starting with an exploration of your 'group' and its nuances, you gain a stereotypical understanding of some other groups and may begin to grasp some methods by which one group can dominate another, and then identify with a group which has the best chances of dominance and goal achievement for yourself and attempt to modify your surroundings to achieve your goals. People who hold their team, party, religion, or ideology as 'the only real' x are stuck at stage 3.1- they are psychopaths who can recognize a group they have explored, but not that other groups may be as real as their own. 


### 3.1- Exploring Self-As-Group. Conceptual understanding of 'others' as members of 'groups,' and exploration of what holds groups together. Cannot separate self from feelings of others in group- groups are reactive to histrionics, as the feelings of 'others' comprising the groups are considered equivalent to those of self.
Physically, can achieve the pinnacles of physical development in terms of coordination and purposeful action. 
Behaviorally- Can learn 'a sport' as an abstract collection of rules for behavior and history of previous behaviors, but may develop a single-minded focus on physically coordinating purposeful actions to gain positive reinforcement to the exclusion of development in other realms- becoming skilled without awareness of subtleties in other areas, and lacking this awareness while being positively reinforced within their specialty may have difficulty developing sophistication in those areas.

Aesthetically- explores boundaries of group standards within sports and other realms. Can learn what others believe and make internal extrapolations through modeling of the variety of 'others' within these groups that they have encountered, down to the level of understanding they have of these others within the groups. Likely to stereotype groups which they are not part of and do not have exposure to.
Systematically- can understand that boundaries of group standards are create by 'specific others' and potentially model these specific others and their processes well enough to understand 


### 3.2- Group-As-Other Selection and identification with specific groups.
People who hold their sport, political system, value system, or method by which memes are transferred as paramount are in 3.2 
basketball is better than baseball, 
America has the best system of government, 
the Old Testament is good/the New Testament is better/Islam is okay but a bit extreme/monotheism is the only answer though, 
rational argument and the scientific method as implemented through statistical analysis and mathematics are the only way to make progress). 

Sociopathic variants may be psychopaths who have managed some skills in group manipulation, they may lack an understanding of the baselines governing functioning of a particular group's members, or they may simply never really get the level 3 platform- the concept of 'the group' may escape them due to a different level consuming their mind. Thus, psychopaths tend to be inept at acting as members of their community but may exhibit surprisingly successful stage 3 capabilities due to their lack of recognition of 'others'- if you understand group dynamics without respecting others you can act without believing that the consequences to these others matter, and this can be a large asset to a group if it is in a situation where the ruthless control by psychopaths allows it to dominate other groups. 

### 3.3- Grouping of Groups
Aesthetic judgments are applied to genres of groups and activities by evaluation of their composite individuals, the range of activities they involve, and the values built and enforced by the communities. 'Sports' may be considered something of interest or value, although this judgment is required by cognitive dissonance at 3.2. 


## 4.0 (systemic/role). Systems Exist Separately From Groups
A basic stage 3 knowledge is a requisite ante for modern life (psychological retardation and abnormalities precluding participation include those which don't allow progression past 1 or 2.) Most psychopaths and people reduced to animal capabilities are incapable of participating in modern society because they cannot be conditioned by 'others' or 'groups', and hence don't learn enough reactions and basic functions to acquire the resources necessary for continued participation in society without being subjected to the attentions of groups with their own ruthless actions. Systemic, level 4 understanding begins with a level 1 knowledge of metagroups- 

Sports- the idea of sports as systems of rules designed for entertainment through the participation of a few athletes refereed by persons, 
Politics- the concept of political systems as a hodgepodge of individual agents/selection methods/capabilities with varying strengths and weaknesses which tend to all coexist in a functioning society, 
Religious Value Systems- the concept of memetics in analysis of contagious belief systems based on the propagation of desirable values by appealing to imagined and often undisprovable concepts, 
Engineering specific changes in systems is possible for people in 4.0 but not likely, as they don't have a sophisticated grasp of how systems interact with selves, others, and groups. 

## 4.1 Exploration of Systemic Boundaries 


## 4.2 Systems as Entities worthy of consideration

## 4.3 Groups as Systems 

## 4.4 Systems as Systems

## 5.0

20151112 2104CST

Did most of the above on the 9th on the plane, continuing from Logan's place in LA. 
On the way home. Been off the meds for a couple days now- flew out on Monday, been having a grand time in LA for tues/weds. Thursday now, headed home to CHI before we head out again tomorrow.

I'll be headed back onto the meds- methylphenidate ER 36mg, bupropion, sertraline. 

Over the past two days been unable to get work done, caustic, acted out a lot, and been drinking. Interestingly haven't been mbing at all for days now, since Sunday, despite being all revved up sun night with no conclusion and then seeing gorgeous ladies all week. One of my longer spells without. 

Anyway, been reading stross. Need to figure out some way of filtering all the fun references out.
